# python-flask-webcam-stream
A basic Python Flask App that allows you to live stream with VLC usage

This was my final project in my Computer Networking class. We developed and deployed a basic Python Flask app to Heroku. With any method, the class implemented a way to live stream through your webcam onto the flask app. The method I used (along with other students) is VLC, which allows you to host your own HTTP live stream server. Once this was accomplished, you can embed your stream into the Flask app and allow the server to process it.

Port forwarding is required.
